### Overview

Customer churn has emerged as a critical concern for companies like SyriaTel in the fiercely competitive telecommunications industry. With customers having numerous options and increasing expectations, retaining existing customers has become paramount. 
Churn not only leads to immediate revenue loss but also exerts significant pressure on customer acquisition costs. Understanding the factors that contribute to churn and being able to predict it with accuracy is crucial for telecom businesses to develop effective retention strategies. By analyzing historical customer data, telecom companies can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and interactions, enabling them to identify potential churners and tailor retention efforts accordingly and proactively.
This proactive approach minimizes revenue loss and enhances customer satisfaction, loyalty, and overall business performance.
